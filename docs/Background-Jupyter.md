# Background: Jupyter

[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) is a fantastic tool for writing code with 
embedded visualizations. We provide one such notebook, `python/Basics.ipynb`, for 
testing the Pyton control interface to a Unity build in the 
[Getting Started with the 3D Balance Ball Environment](Getting-Started-with-Balance-Ball.md).

For a walkthrough of how to use Jupyter, see
[Running the Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/execute.html)
in the _Jupyter/IPython Quick Start Guide_. To launch Jupyter, run in the command line:

`jupyter notebook`

Then navigate to `localhost:8888` to access your notebooks.
