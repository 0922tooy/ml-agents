# Installing ML-Agents for Windows
To get ML-Agents working with Windows, you will need to have Windows 10 installed.  While it is possible for ML-Agents to work on other versions of Windows, we have only tested with a local installation of Windows 10 (not using VM like Bootcamp or Parallels)

## Step 1: Install Nvidia CUDA toolkit
<a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive" target="_blank">Download</a> and install the CUDA toolkit from Nvidia's archive.  You can select the latest or previous releases.  In this guide, we are using version 9.1.85.3 ([direct link](https://developer.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/9.1/Prod/patches/3/cuda_9.1.85.3_windows)).  

_Before installing, please make sure you __close any running instances of Unity or Visual Studio.___
